information from the charts. We can visually see that both the 1-month and 3-month lag are a good signal up until the dot-com bubble crash. After that, we can see that the series begin to diverge but with the 3-month lag appearing to approach the 0-month lag. During the dot-com crash, there was much market instability and uncertainty, perhaps the reason the series appear to converge again later is due to the conditions stabilizing. Additionally, whichever companies did not have sustainable earnings were possibly shaken out and those remaining have stronger operations. Also, the 0-month lag is consistently in between the 1-month and 3-month so we can use those as a bounds for approximation.\n","\n","#### For the second graph, we do see the same pattern of accurate signals pre-dot-com crash with divergence afterwards. In the case of the second graph however, we see that the 1-month and 3-month lag are both drifting away from the 0-month which indicates there is very little information to infer from the graph.
